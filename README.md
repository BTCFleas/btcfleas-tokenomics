# BTC FLEAS Tokenomics

> üé® **All artwork in BTC Fleas was created by C8Y Labs ‚Äî an 8-year-old artist and daughter of an Ordinals collector.**

$TOKEN_TBC is the official token of the BTC Fleas ecosystem ‚Äî a pixelated plague on Bitcoin.  
This token is built to reward flea holders, stakers, and community builders.  
It will launch as a BRC-2.0 token in partnership with [BestInSlot.xyz](https://bestinslot.xyz).

We began building a tight OG group on X and are now migrating members to Discord,  
where access is gated by holding one of only **88 OG Flea Passes**.  
These OG passes qualify for all the perks of the upcoming **800 General Flea Passes** ‚Äî and more.  
As of now, **30/88 OG Passes have already been allocated**.  
Mint yours at [OrdinalGenesis.xyz](https://ordinalgenesis.xyz/mint/btc-fleas).
